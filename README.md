# **TEAM WEBSITE**  
## **Collaborative Web Project Deployment Using GitHub’s Web Interface and Azure Web Apps**

---

# **OBJECTIVE OF THE EXERCISE**  
This exercise is designed to provide hands-on experience in **collaborative web development** and **automated deployment** using GitHub and Azure. By the end of the exercise, participants will have collectively built and deployed a multi-page website to an Azure Web App, all while working entirely within GitHub’s web interface.  

This approach eliminates the need for local Git commands, ensuring accessibility and simplicity for all contributors.

---

# **PRIMARY OBJECTIVE**  
Each participant will contribute **one HTML page** to a shared team website. The completed website will be deployed to an **Azure Web App**, with all contributions and deployments managed through GitHub’s browser-based interface.

---

# **KEY LEARNING OUTCOMES**  

## 1. **Version Control with GitHub (Web-Only)**  
   - Learn how to create branches, add files, and open pull requests (PRs) directly in the GitHub browser interface.  
   - Gain familiarity with GitHub’s web-based tools for version control and collaboration.

## 2. **Collaboration and Code Review**  
   - Understand how to collaborate on the same repository, provide feedback, and follow a structured review process before merging changes.  
   - Foster teamwork and adopt best practices for code review.

## 3. **Continuous Deployment with GitHub Actions and Azure**  
   - Learn how changes made to the main branch trigger an automated deployment to a live Azure Web App.  
   - Experience the power of CI/CD pipelines in modern web development.

By completing this exercise, participants will develop essential skills in **version control**, **collaboration**, and **automated deployment**, preparing them for real-world team-based development workflows.
